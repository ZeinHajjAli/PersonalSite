[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/cba5eae2-33e0-4526-afe2-dbaecf12b196/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zeinhajjali/deploys)

This will be my future personal site once I get all the content moved over from my old Hugo site. Right now the domain is [zeinhajjali.netlify.app](https://zeinhajjali.netlify.app), but I will be connecting my personal domain once I feel that the site is an improvment on the one already hosted there.

## Purpose

The site will include updates to any projects I work on, as well as random blogging.

## Protocol

The site is written in JavaScript (React) and HTML, built using the [GatsbyJS](https://Gatsbyjs.org) static site generator.

I will be setting up the Gatsby Markdown plugin to easily bring over my posts from my existing site.

The site uses [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to build and deploy in production.
